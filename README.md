The purpose of designing this system is to solve issues farmers usually face with storage of their harvested crops. Farmers also often face numerous challenges when it comes to selling their crops. Some of the common issues they face include: Lack of Market Access, limited bargaining power, Quality concerns, post-harvest losses, and lack of market information. To address these issues, we are facilitating our farmers with possible comfort and ease we can provide. So, we have to design the system where we can add farmer accounts and manufacturing companies accounts. We act as intermediate between farmers and companies to best facilitate farmers. A system manager does all this stuff from adding farmers, farmers product and then selling to manufacturing companies with the best profit gained. The system can also keep track of transport facility availed to delivered products to companiesâ€™ premises.
